I recently started at a new postdoc position in the [IAS Research Centre for Life, Mind and Society](http://www.ias-research.net/) at the University of the Basque Country, funded by a postdoc grant from this university. 

I will be working with [Ezequiel Di Paolo](https://ezequieldipaolo.wordpress.com/) in my postdoc project ['Information Theory and Maximum Entropy Modelling in Embodied Organisms'](https://maguilera0.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/postdoc-project-upv-ehu.pdf)
