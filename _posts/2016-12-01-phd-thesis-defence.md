Last week I defended my PhD dissertation entitled 'Interaction Dynamics and Autonomy in Cognitive Systems'. It was a beautiful and intense experience for closing four years of work. The thesis was examined by Ricard Solé, Ezequiel di Paolo and Seth Bullock, which provided several points of discussion for a rich and stimulating debate about the contributions of the dissertation and lines of further development. 

I should thank Manuel Bedia, Xabier Barandiaran and Francisco Serón for their extraordinary work as supervisors and collaborators, as well as many other people that has supported the work developed in this dissertation. The complete dissertation can be freely downloaded from [here](http://phdthesis.maguilera.net/):
