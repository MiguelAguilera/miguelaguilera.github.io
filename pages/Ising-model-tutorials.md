Here I compile some introductory materials to Botlzmann machines and Ising models aimed for students.

#### Botlzmann machines

Some tutorials :
* An [introduction to Boltmzann machines ](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc321/readings/boltz321.pdf) by Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto and Google Brain)
* Some video lectures from this old [course on neural networks](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera_lectures.html) (from video 11a to the end) also by Geoffrey Hinton

#### Ising models
* An [introduction](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/isingIntro.pdf) by Barry Cipra 
* Chapter 31 of [this book](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) from David MacKay.
* This [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ising+model+neurons) by Leonard Susskind

#### Applications
* Machine learning Ising models to capture phase transitions in real neural networks, [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2242) and [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ74VtNffbY) by William Bialek.
