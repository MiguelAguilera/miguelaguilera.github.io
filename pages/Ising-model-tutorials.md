Here I compile some introductory materials to Botlzmann machines and Ising models aimed for students.

#### Botlzmann machines

Some tutorials :
* An [introduction to Boltmzann machines ](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc321/readings/boltz321.pdf) by Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto and Google Brain).
* Some video lectures from this old [course on neural networks](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera_lectures.html) (from video 11a to the end) also by Geoffrey Hinton.

#### Ising models
* Chapter 31 of [this book](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) from David MacKay.
* An [introduction](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/isingIntro.pdf) by Barry Cipra.
* A [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ising+model+neurons) by Leonard Susskind.
* Chapter 1 of [this book](https://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/science_and_technology/physics/Statistical_physics/Statistical%20physics%20of%20spin%20glasses%20and%20information%20processing%20an%20introduction%20-%20Nishimori%20H..pdf) by Hidetoshi Nishimori.

#### Applications
* Machine learning Ising models to capture phase transitions in real neural networks, [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2242) and [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ74VtNffbY) by William Bialek.
