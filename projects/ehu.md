This project was developed at the [IAS Research Centre for Life, Mind and Society](http://www.ias-research.net/) at the University of the Basque Country, funded by a postdoc grant from this university. 

### Abstract:

One of the grand challenges for embodied cognitive science and neuroscience is to understand how behavior arises from the interaction of an organism’s nervous system, its body, and its environment. A limitation faced by embodied approaches is the lack of scalability of most of available analyses and modelling techniques. This limitation contrasts with  recent  successes  in  related  areas using  deep  learning and  predictive  processing architectures,  often  using tools compatible with embodied approaches although with incompatible conceptual assumptions. The current project aims to explore how to circumvent some of these limitations by the combination of data­driven maximum entropy models –statistical mechanics models mapping the statistics of experimental data – with information theoretical tools exploiting the statistical descriptions of the former to provide better indicators of adaptive and embodied neural activity. The project combines theoretical analysis of how statistical models may exploit concepts from statistical thermodynamics and information theory in order to display adaptive behavior, with analysis of experimental models inferred from real­ world neural systems data to apply previous theoretical exploration
